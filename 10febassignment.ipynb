    "The 'close()' function is used to close an open file. it is important to close a file after you are done working with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Free up system resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates system resources to the file. if you don't close the file after you are done working with it, these resources may remain allocated, which can lead to problems like resource exhaustion. by closing the file, you release these resources back to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Ensure data is saved: some operating systems and  file systems may buffer writes to a file in memory insted of writing them directly to the disk, if you don't close the file, these writes may not be saved to the disk, which means that you may loss data if something goes wrong(power failure). By closing the file, you ensure that any  buffered writes are saved to the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Avoid conflicts with other programs: Some operating systems may lock a file  while it  is open by a programs, preventing other programs from accessing the file. if you don't close the file, it may remain locked , which can preventing other programs from using it. by closing the file , you relase the lock and  allow other programs to access the file."
